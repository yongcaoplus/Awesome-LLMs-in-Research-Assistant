# ðŸ“š Awesome LLMs in Research Assistant

![](./img/logo.png)

With the powerful capabilities of LLMs in understanding and processing scientific documents, their application as research assistants has become increasingly promising. In this repo, we aim to provide **a comprehensive overview of the latest awesome works that leverage LLMs as research assistants**. We also include platforms, tutorials, and workshops to help you get started with your relevant projects.

Any contributions and discussions are welcome!
